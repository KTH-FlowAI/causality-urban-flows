/**
 * A basic interface for calculators computing measures on a <i>channel</i> from a
 * source to a destination time-series (i.e. mutual information and transfer entropy).
 * In the following, we refer to the abstract measure computed by this calculator
 * as the <i>"channel measure"</i>.
 * 
 * <p>The interface is <b>abstract</b> because further specification is required
 * for addObservations or setObservations methods showing whether
 * this is a univariate ({@link ChannelCalculator}) or multivariate 
 * {@link ChannelCalculatorMultiVariate} measure.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage of the child classes implementing this interface is intended to follow this paradigm:
 * </p>
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Construct the calculator;</li>
 * 		<li>Set properties using {@link #setProperty(String, String)};</li>
 *		<li>Initialise the calculator using {@link #initialise()} or
 *			other initialise methods defined by child classes;
 *		</li>
 * 		<li>Provide the observations/samples for the calculator
 *      	to set up the PDFs, using:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>a "setObservations" method (defined by child classes)
 * 				for calculations based on single time-series, OR</li>
 * 				<li>The following sequence:<ol>
 * 						<li>{@link #startAddObservations()}, then</li>
 * 						<li>One or more calls to "addObservations" methods
 * 						(defined by children), then</li>
 * 						<li>{@link #finaliseAddObservations()};</li>
 * 					</ol></li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>Compute the required quantities, being one or more of:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>the average of the channel measure: {@link #computeAverageLocalOfObservations()};</li>
 * 				<li>the local channel measure values for these samples: {@link #computeLocalOfPreviousObservations()}</li>
 * 				<li>local channel measure values for a specific set of samples: "computeLocalUsingPreviousObservations"
 * 					(to be defined by child classes);</li>
 * 				<li>the distribution of the channel measure values under the null hypothesis
 * 					of no relationship between source and destination
 * 					values: {@link #computeSignificance(int)} or
 * 					{@link #computeSignificance(int[][])}.</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 		Return to step 2 or 3 to re-use the calculator on a new data set.
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ol>
