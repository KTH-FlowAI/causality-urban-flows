/**
 * <p>Computes the differential conditional transfer entropy (TE) between two univariate
 *  <code>double[]</code> time-series of observations
 *  (implementing {@link ConditionalTransferEntropyCalculator}),
 *  assuming that the probability distribution function for these observations is
 *  a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
 *  TE was defined by Schreiber, conditional TE by Lizier et al.,
 *  and Kaiser and Schreiber showed how to compute
 *  TE via the Gaussian assumption.
 *  This estimator is realised here by plugging in
 *  {@link ConditionalMutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariateGaussian}
 *  as the calculator into the parent class
 *  {@link ConditionalTransferEntropyCalculatorViaCondMutualInfo}.</p>
 *  
 * <p>That is, this class implements a conditional TE calculator using model of 
 * Gaussian variables with linear interactions, making it equivalent
 * (up to a multiplicative constant) to the (partial) Granger causality (see Barnett et al below).
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p>Usage is as per the paradigm outlined for {@link ConditionalTransferEntropyCalculator},
 * with:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>The constructor step being a simple call to
 * 		{@link #ConditionalTransferEntropyCalculatorGaussian()}.</li>
 * 	<li>{@link #setProperty(String, String)} allowing properties defined for both
 * 		{@link ConditionalTransferEntropyCalculator#setProperty(String, String)} and
 *      {@link ConditionalMutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariateGaussian#setProperty(String, String)}
 *      as outlined
 *      in {@link ConditionalTransferEntropyCalculatorViaCondMutualInfo#setProperty(String, String)}).</li>
 * 	<li>The user can call {@link #setCovariance(double[][], int)}
 *     instead of supplying observations via {@link #setObservations(double[], double[], double[][])} or
 *     {@link #addObservations(double[], double[], double[][])} etc.</li>
 *  <li>Computed values are in <b>nats</b>, not bits!</li>
 *  <li>Additional method {@link #computeSignificance()} to compute null distribution analytically.</li>
 *  </ul>
