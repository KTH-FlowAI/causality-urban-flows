 * 		<li>Construct the calculator;</li>
 * 		<li>Set properties using {@link #setProperty(String, String)};</li>
 *		<li>Initialise the calculator using {@link #initialise(int)};</li>
 * 		<li>Provide the observations/samples for the calculator
 *      	to set up the PDFs, using:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>{@link #setObservations(double[][])}
 * 					for calculations based on single time-series, OR</li>
 * 				<li>The following sequence:<ol>
 * 						<li>{@link #startAddObservations()}, then</li>
 * 						<li>One or more calls to {@link #addObservations(double[][])} or
 * 							{@link #addObservation(double[])}, then</li>
 * 						<li>{@link #finaliseAddObservations()};</li>
 * 					</ol></li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		<li>Compute the required quantities, being one or more of:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>the average multi-information:
 *					{@link #computeAverageLocalOfObservations()};</li>
 * 				<li>the local multi-information values for these samples:
 * 					{@link #computeLocalOfPreviousObservations()}</li>
 * 				<li>local multi-information values for a specific set of samples:
 * 					{@link #computeLocalUsingPreviousObservations(double[][])}</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
