/**
 * <p>Interface for implementations of the <b>mutual information</b>,
 * which may be applied to either multivariate or merely univariate
 * continuous data.
 * That is, it is applied to <code>double[][]</code> data, where the first index
 * is observation number or time, and the second is variable number.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage of the child classes implementing this interface is intended to follow this paradigm:
 * </p>
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Construct the calculator;</li>
 * 		<li>Set properties using {@link #setProperty(String, String)}
 * 			which may now include the property {@link #PROP_TIME_DIFF}
 * 			to specify a source-destination time difference (default 0);</li>
 *		<li>Initialise the calculator using {@link #initialise()} or
 *			{@link #initialise(int, int)};</li>
 * 		<li>Provide the observations/samples for the calculator
 *      	to set up the PDFs, using:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>{@link #setObservations(double[][], double[][])},
 * 					{@link #setObservations(double[][], double[][], boolean[], boolean[])} or
 * 					{@link #setObservations(double[][], double[][], boolean[][], boolean[][])}
 * 					for calculations based on single time-series, OR</li>
 * 				<li>The following sequence:<ol>
 * 						<li>{@link #startAddObservations()}, then</li>
 * 						<li>One or more calls to {@link #addObservations(double[][], double[][])} or
 * 							{@link #addObservations(double[][], double[][], int, int)}, then</li>
 * 						<li>{@link #finaliseAddObservations()};</li>
 * 					</ol></li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		<li>Compute the required quantities, being one or more of:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>the average MI: {@link #computeAverageLocalOfObservations()};</li>
 * 				<li>the local MI values for these samples: {@link #computeLocalOfPreviousObservations()}</li>
 * 				<li>local MI values for a specific set of samples: {@link #computeLocalUsingPreviousObservations(double[])}</li>
 * 				<li>the distribution of MI values under the null hypothesis
 * 					of no relationship between source and
 * 					destination values: {@link #computeSignificance(int)} or
 * 					{@link #computeSignificance(int[][])}.</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 		Return to step 2 or 3 to re-use the calculator on a new data set.
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ol>
