 * Interface for implementations of

 * <p>
 * Usage of the child classes implementing this interface is intended to follow this paradigm:
 * </p>
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Construct the calculator;</li>
 * 		<li>Set properties using {@link #setProperty(String, String)};</li>
 *		<li>Initialise the calculator {@link #initialise(int)};</li>
 * 		<li>Provide the observations/samples for the calculator
 *      to set up the PDFs, using:
 * 			{@link #setObservations(double[][])};</li>
 * 		<li>Compute the required quantities, being one or more of:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>the average entropy: {@link #computeAverageLocalOfObservations()};</li>
 * 				<li>the local entropy values for these samples: {@link #computeLocalOfPreviousObservations()}</li>
 * 				<li>local entropy values for a specific set of samples:
 * 					{@link #computeLocalUsingPreviousObservations(double[])}.</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>Return to step 2 or 3 to re-use the calculator on a new data set.</li>
