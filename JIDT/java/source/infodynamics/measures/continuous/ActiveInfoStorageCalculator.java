/**
 * Interface for implementations of
 * Active Information Storage estimators on continuous univariate data (ie double[] arrays).
 * 
 * <p>See definition of Active Information Storage (AIS) by Lizier et al. below.
 * Basically, AIS is the mutual information between the past <i>state</i>
 * of a time-series process <i>X</i> and its next value. The past <i>state</i> at time <code>n</code>
 * is represented by an embedding vector of <code>k</code> values from <code>X_n</code> backwards,
 * each separated by <code>\tau</code> steps, giving
 * <code><b>X^k_n</b> = [ X_{n-(k-1)\tau}, ... , X_{n-\tau}, X_n]</code>.
 * We call <code>k</code> the embedding dimension, and <code>\tau</code>
 * the embedding delay.
 * AIS is then the mutual information between <b>X^k_n</b> and X_{n+1}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage of the child classes implementing this interface is intended to follow this paradigm:
 * </p>
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Construct the calculator;</li>
 * 		<li>Set properties using {@link #setProperty(String, String)};</li>
 *		<li>Initialise the calculator using {@link #initialise()} or
 *			{@link #initialise(int)} or {@link #initialise(int, int)};
 *		</li>
 * 		<li>Provide the observations/samples for the calculator
 *      	to set up the PDFs, using:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>{@link #setObservations(double[])} or
 * 					{@link #setObservations(double[], boolean[])} for calculations
 * 					based on single time-series, OR</li>
 * 				<li>The following sequence:<ol>
 * 						<li>{@link #startAddObservations()}, then</li>
 * 						<li>One or more calls to {@link #addObservations(double[])} or
 * 							{@link #addObservations(double[], int, int)}, then</li>
 * 						<li>{@link #finaliseAddObservations()};</li>
 * 					</ol></li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>Compute the required quantities, being one or more of:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>the average AIS: {@link #computeAverageLocalOfObservations()};</li>
 * 				<li>the local AIS values for these samples: {@link #computeLocalOfPreviousObservations()}</li>
 * 				<li>local AIS values for a specific set of samples: {@link #computeLocalUsingPreviousObservations(double[])}</li>
 * 				<li>the distribution of AIS values under the null hypothesis
 * 					of no relationship between past sequences in the series
 * 					and the next value: {@link #computeSignificance(int)} or
 * 					{@link #computeSignificance(int[][])}.</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 		Return to step 2 or 3 to re-use the calculator on a new data set.
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ol>
