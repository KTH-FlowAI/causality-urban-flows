/**
 * <p>Interface defining computation of the differential mutual information between a given multivariate set of
 *  observations 
 *  and a discrete variable.
 *  This is done by examining the conditional probability distribution (given the discrete
 *  variable) against the probability distribution for the multivariate set.</p>
 *  
 * <p>
 * Usage intended for the child classes:
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Construct the child class</li>
 *		<li>{@link #initialise(int, int)} to tell the class the number of dimensions of the continuous observations,
 *          and the base (number of available states) of the discrete variable.</li>
 * 		<li>Set properties using {@link #setProperty(String, String)}</li>
 * 		<li>Provide the observations to the calculator using:
 * 			{@link #setObservations(double[][], int[])}.</li>
 * 		<li>Compute the required information-theoretic results, primarily:
 * 			{@link #computeAverageLocalOfObservations()} to return the average 
 *          MI; or other calls to compute
 *          local values or statistical significance.</li>
 * 	</ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>These calculators are <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b> -- not properly tested,
 * and not well documented. The intended calling pattern is similar to
 * {@link MutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariate}
