/**
 * A basic interface for calculators computing measures on a univariate <i>channel</i>
 * for discrete (ie int[]) data from a
 * source to a destination time-series (ie mutual information and transfer entropy).
 * In the following, we refer to the abstract measure computed by this calculator
 * as the <i>"channel measure"</i>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage of the child classes implementing this interface is intended to follow this paradigm:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * 		<li>Construct the calculator;</li>
 *		<li>Initialise the calculator using {@link #initialise()} or
 *			other initialise methods defined by child classes;
 * 		<li>Provide the observations/samples for the calculator
 *      	to set up the PDFs, using one or more calls to
 * 			the set of {@link #addObservations(int[], int[])} methods, then</li>
 * 		<li>Compute the required quantities, being one or more of:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>the average channel measure: {@link #computeAverageLocalOfObservations()};</li>
 * 				<li>the distribution of channel measure values under the null hypothesis
 * 					of no relationship between source and
 * 					destination values: {@link #computeSignificance(int)};</li>
 * 				<li>or other quantities as defined by child classes.</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 		Return to step 2 to re-use the calculator on a new data set.
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ol>
