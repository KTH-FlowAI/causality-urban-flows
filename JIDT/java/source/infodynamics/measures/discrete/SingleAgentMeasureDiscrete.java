/**
 * Interface for calculators of information-theoretic measures
 * for single variables (e.g. entropy, active information storage).
 * The interface defines common operations such as
 * adding observations and calculating
 * local and average values, etc. 
 * 
 * <p>Usage is as per {@link InfoMeasureCalculatorDiscrete}, with
 * many methods for supplying observations and making 
 * calculations defined here.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It would ideally be an abstract class to be inherited from, but
 * it's more important for some of our calculators to have inheritance from
 * ContextOfPastCalculator, and since java doesn't allow multiple
 * inheritance, one of them has to miss out.
 * To get around this, we combine the two in
 * {@link SingleAgentMeasureDiscreteInContextOfPastCalculator}.
