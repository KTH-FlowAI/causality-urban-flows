/** Interface for {@link UnivariateSolver (univariate real) root-finding
 * algorithms} that maintain a bracketed solution. There are several advantages
 * to having such root-finding algorithms:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>The bracketed solution guarantees that the root is kept within the
 *      interval. As such, these algorithms generally also guarantee
 *      convergence.</li>
 *  <li>The bracketed solution means that we have the opportunity to only
 *      return roots that are greater than or equal to the actual root, or
 *      are less than or equal to the actual root. That is, we can control
 *      whether under-approximations and over-approximations are
 *      {@link AllowedSolution allowed solutions}. Other root-finding
 *      algorithms can usually only guarantee that the solution (the root that
 *      was found) is around the actual root.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For backwards compatibility, all root-finding algorithms must have
 * {@link AllowedSolution#ANY_SIDE ANY_SIDE} as default for the allowed
 * solutions.</p>
 * @param <FUNC> Type of function to solve.
